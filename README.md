# ChemReact
Discover the best chemical reactions with ChemReact, an open-source machine learning app built with Electron. Predict energy outputs and find the top element combinations.

## Key Features
- Uses Electron for the graphical user interface
- Trains a machine learning model using data from the periodic table
- Determines the best combination of elements for maximum energy output

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the app with `npm start`

## Usage
1. Select the elements to include in the reaction
2. The app will predict the energy output and suggest the best combination of elements
